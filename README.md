# While-Loop
This program is meant to print “Hello I am Trying” five times, but because the value of i never changes, it creates an infinite loop and keeps printing the message forever.

While Loop 
📌 Overview

This program demonstrates a while loop in C.
It starts counting from i = 1 and checks if i <= 5.
Since the value of i never changes, the loop runs forever, printing the same message repeatedly.

⚙️ How It Works

i is set to 1.

The while condition i <= 5 is checked.

Because i never increases, the condition is always true.

The program keeps printing:

Hello I am Trying


endlessly until you manually stop it.

▶️ How to Run

Save the program file (e.g., hello_loop.c) in your system.
Compile it using GCC or any C compiler:
